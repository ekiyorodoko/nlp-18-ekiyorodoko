# NLP - 2018 - EKIYOR ODOKO
Natural Language Processing - Fall 2018 Lab
This is a repository containing all project and lab code by Ekiyor Odoko in the Natural Language Processing class of Ashesi University's Fall 2018 semester.  

## Lab Project 1
In this project, I implemented Jurafsky's pseudocode to build a binary naive bayes classifier
**Note:** The classifier was trained with dataset containing reviews of products, movies etc. So it predicts either 0 or 1 i.e. negative and positive respectively

### Instructions
To test this classifier, you need to:
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to this directory "Lab Projects/LabProject1"
3. Run the command **python my_naive_bayes.py**
4. Wait for a prompt, then provide the path to the document you want to classify
5. When the program is done running, a *files.txt* document is created. This document contains the class of each review on a new line
